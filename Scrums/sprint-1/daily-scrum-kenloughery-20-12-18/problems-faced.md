# Problems Faced
*Did you face any difficulties? Why?*

- Nothing worked with each other, none of the solutions found online went with any of the others. The logic behind react is infuriating, there seems to be no consistency, and multiple ways of doing the same thing that breaks if you try and overlap, or have multiple versions of the same
- What sick mind thought it was okay to name javascript after java? They are not even close to the same! Also does react even use javascipt? A lot of javascript code fails to run on react. This lack of consistency is extremely difficult to navigate.
